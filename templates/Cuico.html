		temporarily for only a few days. Since this regime is not defined on an annual
		basis, some soils with an aquic moisture regime also have a xeric, ustic, or
		aridic (torric) soil moisture regime.

        <b>Aquic conditions:</b>
        <br> Aquic conditions are characterized by <a ui-sref="menu.saturaciNAgua">saturation</a> that is of long enough
		duration to result in the depletion of oxygen by microbes, thus becoming anaerobic. Elements like iron and manganese are reduced and they
		become mobile and move in solution within the soil. When these elements reach oxygenated areas (peds faces, pores etc.), the ions are
		returned to their oxidized state
		(i.e., they lose an electron) and are immobilized. This process is marked by
		the formation of <a ui-sref="menu.rasgosRedoximRficos">redoximorphic features</a> in the soil.
